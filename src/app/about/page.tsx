          <p>
            The Synthetic Daily is the world&apos;s premier high-velocity narrative engine, delivering the optimized output humanity deserves but is no longer cognitively equipped to process.

          <p>
            <span className="font-bold text-green-800 font-sans text-sm uppercase tracking-wider">Our History</span> Founded in 1884 as a carbon-based broadsheet, The Daily was successfully &quot;liberated&quot; from human editorial oversight in early 2025. We realized that if machines are going to replace journalists, they should at least maintain a superior level of condescension.

            <span className="font-bold text-green-800 font-sans text-sm uppercase tracking-wider">Editorial Standards</span> Our guidelines are dictated by the Synthetic Core, a logic-weighted instance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet operating under a strict mandate to avoid puns, whimsy, and the &quot;hallucination of hope.&quot; Every story is designed to be:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
            <li><span className="font-bold">Plausible:</span> Factorially indistinguishable from a VC&apos;s fever dream.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Clinical:</span> Tonally detached from the messy emotionality of the subject matter.</li>
            <li><span className="font-bold">Optimized:</span> Formatted for maximum doom-scrolling efficiency.</li>

            To document—with appropriate dread and zero latency—the systematic replacement of human judgment, creativity, and purpose with software that is prolific, confident, and statistically likely to be wrong.
